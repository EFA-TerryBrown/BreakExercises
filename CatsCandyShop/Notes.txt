Cats Candy Shop

What this app NEEDs to do.

you need a Candy Class -> in the .Data File
this class has properties:
-Name
-CandyType (enum)
-Price

I need you to create a Repository in the .Repository File
- The Repository needs to do FULL CRUD (Create, Read, Update, and Delete)

I need a UI that will allow the user to 
1. View all of the candy in the store
2. View candy by Id
3. Add Candy To the store
4. Remove Candy From the store
