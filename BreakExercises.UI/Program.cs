//Call the methods from Program_UI
Program_UI ui = new Program_UI();

//call the method ui.Greeter("Craig")
//it should take in a string
ui.Greeter("Craig!");

//call the method ui.Add(1,100)
//the method should take in two intergers and return an interger

//call the method ui.IsAnEvenNumber(50)
//the method should 'RETURN a String => if the value is even it should return 'Is Even'
//if the value is odd => return 'Is Odd'

//right click on BreakExercises.UI -> create a new C# 
//Name it 'Person'
//Give the Person class some properties:
//string Name
//DateTime DateOfBirth
//List<Person> Friends


//new-up a person here, 
//and use 'object initialization'
//to create friends for the person

//right click on BreakExercises.UI -> create a new C# 
//Name it 'Animal'
//Give the Animal class some properties:
//string Name
//Create a Method called Speak()
//

//right click on BreakExercises.UI -> create a new C# 
//Name it 'Dog'
//Make the 'Dog' class inherit from 'Animal'
//Give the Dog class some properties:
//string 
//Override Method called Speak() (from the Animail inheritance)
//

//new-up a Dog here, 
//call the speak Method => the console should write out a message.

//if you have any other ideas  like your own Methods or properties 
//that you want to add to any of these above classes 
//please give it a shot and happy coding!
